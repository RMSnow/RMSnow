My name is Xueyao Zhang (张雪遥). I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen), supervised by Professor [Zhizheng Wu](http://www.drwuz.com/). My research interest is to **study *Music* from the perspective of *Artificial Intelligence***. In particular, my ongoing works focus on Singing Voice Conversion (SVC). To know more about SVC, you can read [this tutorial](https://www.zhangxueyao.com/data/SVC/tutorial.html) and [my latest work](https://www.zhangxueyao.com/data/MultipleContentsSVC/index.html). Recently, I'm participating in and leading the development of the prototype of the open-source *[Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion)* toolkit.

Before CUHK-Shenzhen, I received my master's degree (2019-2022) at the Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS), working on computational social science, especially on **Fake News Detection** and **Fact Checking**.
